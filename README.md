### Chapter 6: Exercises in TOS 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7

#### **6.4. Exercise - Find the Oldest Bug. Find the oldest bug that's still open in your chosen project. Write a blog entry describing the problem, with a theory about why the bug hasn't been resolved yet. (Bonus points if you can actually resolve the bug.)**

The oldest bug in the TEAMMATES open source project was issue #4345. I sorted through the issues by filtering by oldest and with the label `bug`. This bug causes an issue when an instructor searches for students who are taking a lot of courses, this causes the query to be long and an error to occur because the query string is longer than 2000 bytes. The bug was oppened in 2015, has not resolved and has been mentioned in other issues.

#### **6.5. Exercise - Create Your Bug Tracker Account. Figure out how to create a new account on the bug tracker of your chosen project. You'll need that account very soon.**

The project we are working on is an open ource project on github called TEAMMATES. My github handle is [@Grahamet](https://github.com/Grahamet)

#### **6.6.1. Exercise - Reproduce a Bug. Go through your project's bug tracker and find a bug that you think you might be able to reproduce - and then try to reproduce it in the latest build. Take careful notes. Report your experiences as a comment to the bug. If you can reproduce the bug, great! Give as much information as you can. If you can't reproduce the bug, great! Give as much information as you can, and ask the original reporter if there are other steps you might be able to take to reproduce the bug.**

I was able to reproduce a typo, which I understand isn't a bug. In the issue there is a type in the edit questions form. It had `Save Questions` instead of `Save Question`. This type was fixed by our team member Chloe Stapleton.

#### **6.7.1. Exercise - Bug Triage. Find five bug reports in the new state, and attempt to triage them according to the rules above. Your goal is to do as much as you possibly can, in a short period of time, to make those bug reports as useful as possible to the developer to whom they are assigned.(Note: be sure to follow any triage rules that your project may have defined. If there is no set triage rules, be sure to announce your intentions on the project's mailing list, so that developers can provide you some guidelines if they choose.)**

- Letting the user know that someone has looked at it
- Looking for other similar bugs
- Guaranteeing proper severity and/or priority
- Ensuring that the bug is sensible and helpful to developers
- Ensuring that the bug is filed against the correct component, with the correct version
