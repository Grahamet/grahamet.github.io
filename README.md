## HW1: Chapter 1

### 1.3 What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four other attributes that may sometimes be significant.
  - Acceptability 
  - Dependability & Security
  - Efficiency
  - Maintainability
  
### 1.8 Discuss whether professional software engineers should be liscensed in the same way as doctors or lawyers.
  - I believe that professional software engineers should be liscenesed the same way doctors are liscenced. I believe this because Software engineers are responsible for the software in devices that can impact a person health such as insulin pumps to ai. They should be liscened so only people who aren't ignorant to ethics can   
    create the software with minimal accidents that could happen. 
    
### 1.9 For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an appropriate example that illustrates that clause.
  -Public: Software engineers shouldn't create software that could negatively impact the general public or clients such as viruses. 
  
  -Client and Employer: Duty to fulfil your job of creating software that only has one purpose without being used for secondary purposes that goes against public
   interest such as obtaining and then selling personal information.
   
  -Product: Software engineers should test the integrity and functionality of ther programs before submitting there final product.
  
  -Judgement: Software engineer should be able to refuse to work on something that is against their ethics.
  
  -Management: Software engineering managers should be enforcing ethical software development and hold members accountable for violating ethics or legal rules.
  
  -Profession: Software engineers shouldn't be postponing maintaining the integretiyof their software for personal gain.
  
  -Colleagues: Software engineers should be respectful of other Software engineers and be able to have intellectual conversations without consequences.
  
  -Self: Software engineers should be continuously testing themselves and pushing themselves to learn more.
  
### 1.10 To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer systems that track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, this has privacy implications. Discuss the ethics of working on the development of this type of system.
  - There are many ethical issues to having software that tracks large numbers of citizens and their actions because the information could be stolen or used for a secondary purpose by others such as the government will not willing close it.
